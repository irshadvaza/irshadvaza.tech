## 🎯 What You Will Learn

In this chapter, you will learn:

- ✅ How to write comments in Python  
- ✅ How to print output properly  
- ✅ Different ways to print variables (string formatting)  
- ✅ Basic data types (quick revision)  
- ✅ Type conversion (casting)  
- ✅ Taking input from users  

This chapter is very important before moving to loops and conditions.

# 📝 1. Comments in Python

Comments are notes inside your code.  
Python ignores them during execution.

They are used to:
- Explain logic
- Help other developers
- Make code readable
- Add reminders

---

## 🔹 Single Line Comment

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello Python")  # This prints text
🔹 Multi-Line Comment
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
Used for explanation
"""
print("Welcome")
💡 Good programmers always write comments.

🖨 2. The print() Function
print() is used to display output.

print("Hello World")
Output:

Hello World
🔤 3. Printing Variables (String Formatting)
This is VERY important for beginners.

There are multiple ways to print variables.

🔹 Method 1: Comma Separation (Simple Way)
x = 10
print("The value of x is", x)
Output:

The value of x is 10
✅ Easy and beginner-friendly
⚠ Slight extra space added automatically

🔹 Method 2: Old Style Formatting (%)
x = 10
print("The value of x is %s" % x)
Multiple Variables
x = 10
y = 20
print("x = %s and y = %s" % (x, y))
Float Formatting (Decimal Control)
x = 786.12344
print("The value of x is %.2f" % x)
Output:

The value of x is 786.12
💡 %.2f → 2 decimal places

🔹 Method 3: format() Method
x = 10
print("The value of x is {}".format(x))
Multiple Variables
x = 10
y = 20
print("x = {} and y = {}".format(x, y))
Using Named Keys
print("x = {a}, y = {b}".format(a=10, b=20))
🔹 Method 4: f-Strings (Recommended ✅)
Best and modern way (Python 3.6+)

x = 10
print(f"The value of x is {x}")
Multiple Variables
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
Decimal Formatting in f-string
x = 786.12344
print(f"The value of x is {x:.2f}")
Output:

The value of x is 786.12
💡 {x:.2f} → 2 decimal places

🔢 4. Basic Data Types (Quick Revision)
Type	Example
int	10
float	10.5
str	"Hello"
bool	True / False
Example:

age = 25          # int
price = 99.99     # float
name = "Irshad"   # string
is_active = True  # boolean
🔄 5. Type Conversion (Casting)
Sometimes we need to change data type.

🔹 String to Integer
x = "10"
y = int(x)
print(y + 5)
🔹 Integer to String
age = 25
text = str(age)
print("My age is " + text)
🔹 Convert to Float
x = "10"
y = float(x)
print(y)
⌨ 6. Taking Input from User
Python allows user interaction.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
Important: Input is Always String!
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print(type(age))
Output:

<class 'str'>
To convert:

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(age + 5)
🧪 Practice Section
✅ Exercise 1
Print your name and age using:

Comma method

% method

format()

f-string

✅ Exercise 2
Take two numbers from user and print their sum.

✅ Exercise 3
Print a floating number with:

1 decimal place

3 decimal places
