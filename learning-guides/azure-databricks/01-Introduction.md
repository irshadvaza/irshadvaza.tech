## 🏢 2️⃣ Why Do We Need Databricks?

### ❌ Problem with Traditional Systems

Earlier, companies used **separate systems** for different purposes:

- SQL Server / Oracle → Structured data  
- Hadoop clusters → Big data  
- Separate ML tools → Machine learning  
- Separate BI tools → Reporting  

This caused:

- Too many tools  
- Slow data processing  
- High infrastructure cost  
- Complex integration  
- Data silos  

Managing everything became difficult and expensive.
