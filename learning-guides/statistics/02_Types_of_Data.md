# 📘 Chapter 2 – Types of Data

## 🎯 Why Understanding Types of Data is Important

Before calculating mean, probability, regression, or building machine learning models, we must answer:

> **What kind of data are we working with?**

**Why it matters:**

- Determines which statistical method to use
- Wrong method → Wrong conclusion
- Correct classification → Accurate analysis

**Example:**

- You can calculate **average salary** ✅  
- You cannot calculate **average gender** ❌  

Understanding data types is the **foundation of statistics and data science**.

## 🧠 Step 1: Broad Classification of Data

Data is divided into two main categories:

1️⃣ **Qualitative Data (Categorical Data)**  
2️⃣ **Quantitative Data (Numerical Data)**  

> The type of data determines the kind of analysis you can perform.

# 1️⃣ Qualitative Data (Categorical Data)

### 📌 Simple Meaning
Qualitative data describes **qualities, labels, or categories**.  
It answers:

- What type?
- Which category?
- What group?

It **does not represent numbers** that we can calculate mathematically.

**Example:**

| Student Name | Gender | Blood Group |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| Aisha        | Female | O+         |
| Rahul        | Male   | B+         |

- Gender → Categorical  
- Blood Group → Categorical  

> You cannot calculate the average of Male/Female or Blood Groups.

### 🔹 Types of Qualitative Data

#### A) Nominal Data
- **Meaning:** Categories with **no specific order**  
- **Examples:** Gender, Blood Group, City Names, Department Names  
- **Key:** Just names or labels

#### B) Ordinal Data
- **Meaning:** Categories with a **meaningful order/ranking**  
- **Examples:** Education Level, Customer Rating (1–5), Severity Level  
- **Key:** Order exists but differences between levels are not measurable

# 2️⃣ Quantitative Data (Numerical Data)

### 📌 Simple Meaning
Quantitative data represents **numbers that can be measured or calculated**.

**Example:**

| Employee | Salary | Age |
|----------|--------|-----|
| John     | 50,000 | 30  |
| Meera    | 60,000 | 35  |

- Salary → Quantitative  
- Age → Quantitative  

> We can calculate average, variance, or standard deviation.

---

### 🔹 Types of Quantitative Data

#### A) Discrete Data
- **Meaning:** Countable numbers (whole numbers)  
- **Examples:** Number of students, Number of cars, Patients count  

#### B) Continuous Data
- **Meaning:** Measurable numbers (can have decimals)  
- **Examples:** Height, Weight, Temperature, Blood Pressure
