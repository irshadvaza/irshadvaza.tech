# 🚀 Chapter 1: Introduction to Azure Data Factory (ADF)

---

# 🌍 What is Azure Data Factory?

**Azure Data Factory (ADF)** is a cloud-based data integration service provided by Microsoft inside the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

It allows you to:

- 🔄 Move data between different systems  
- 🔧 Transform data  
- 🏗️ Build automated data pipelines  
- ☁️ Work fully in the cloud  

Think of ADF as a **Data Movement & Orchestration Engine**.

---

# 🧠 Why Do We Need Azure Data Factory?

In real-world organizations:

- Data exists in SQL databases  
- Files are stored in Blob Storage  
- Reports are built in Power BI  
- APIs provide live data  
- On-prem servers store legacy data  

👉 We need a tool to connect everything.

That tool is **Azure Data Factory**.

---

# 🏢 Real-World Example (Simple Scenario)

Imagine you work in an environmental agency.

### Daily Requirement:

1. Sensors collect air quality data.
2. Data is stored in:
   - SQL Server
   - CSV files
3. Every night:
   - Move data to Data Lake
   - Clean & transform data
   - Load into reporting database
   - Refresh dashboard

Instead of doing this manually...

✅ We create an **ADF Pipeline** that runs automatically every night.

---

# 🏗️ Core Components of Azure Data Factory

---

## 1️⃣ Pipeline

A **Pipeline** is like a workflow.

It is a collection of activities that perform a task.

Example:
- Copy data
- Run SQL query
- Execute Databricks notebook
- Send email

Pipeline = Project  
Activity = Task inside project  

---

## 2️⃣ Activity

Activities are the building blocks inside a pipeline.

Common activities:

- Copy Activity
- Lookup Activity
- Web Activity
- Stored Procedure Activity
- Databricks Notebook Activity

---

## 3️⃣ Dataset

Dataset represents the **data structure**.

Examples:
- SQL Table
- CSV File
- JSON File
- Parquet File

It tells ADF:
- Where data is
- What format it is

---

## 4️⃣ Linked Service

Linked Service is the **connection information**.

It connects ADF to:

- Azure SQL Database
- Blob Storage
- REST API
- On-Prem SQL Server
- Databricks

It contains:
- Connection string
- Authentication details

---

## 5️⃣ Trigger

Triggers run pipelines automatically.

Types:
- Schedule Trigger (e.g., daily at 2 AM)
- Tumbling Window Trigger
- Event-based Trigger (when file arrives)

---

# 🔄 How Azure Data Factory Works (Step-by-Step Flow)

```
Source System → Linked Service → Dataset → Activity → Pipeline → Trigger
```

### Practical Flow:

1. Connect to SQL Server (Linked Service)
2. Define Table (Dataset)
3. Add Copy Activity
4. Create Pipeline
5. Add Schedule Trigger
6. Publish
7. Pipeline runs automatically 🎉

# 🖼️ Architecture Overview

Azure Data Factory works inside Microsoft Azure.

It can connect to:

- On-Prem Systems
- Cloud Systems
- APIs
- Databricks
- Data Lake
- SQL Databases

It supports Hybrid Integration using:

- Self-hosted Integration Runtime

---

# 🔥 Types of Integration Runtime (IR)

Integration Runtime is the engine that moves data.

### 1️⃣ Azure IR
For cloud-to-cloud data movement.

### 2️⃣ Self-Hosted IR
For on-prem to cloud movement.

### 3️⃣ Azure-SSIS IR
For running SSIS packages in cloud.

# 🆚 Azure Data Factory vs Traditional ETL

| Traditional ETL | Azure Data Factory |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Installed on server | Fully cloud-based |
| Manual scaling | Auto scaling |
| High maintenance | Managed service |
| Limited connectivity | 100+ connectors |

---

# 🧩 ADF + Other Azure Services

Azure Data Factory works very well with:

- Azure Databricks
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Data Lake Storage
- Power BI
- Microsoft Fabric

It acts as the **Orchestrator** of the entire data ecosystem.

---

# 🎯 When Should You Use Azure Data Factory?

Use ADF when:

✔️ You need automated data movement  
✔️ You want cloud-based ETL  
✔️ You want to schedule pipelines  
✔️ You need hybrid connectivity  
✔️ You are building data warehouse / lakehouse  

---

# 🛠️ Simple Example: Copy Data from SQL to Blob

### Scenario:

Move data from Azure SQL table to CSV file in Blob Storage.

### Steps:

1️⃣ Create Azure Data Factory  
2️⃣ Create Linked Service for:
   - Azure SQL Database
   - Blob Storage  
3️⃣ Create Dataset for:
   - SQL Table
   - CSV File  
4️⃣ Create Pipeline  
5️⃣ Add Copy Activity  
6️⃣ Map source to sink  
7️⃣ Debug  
8️⃣ Publish  
9️⃣ Add Trigger  

Done ✅

# 🧪 What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- ADF reads from source
- Uses Integration Runtime
- Transfers data securely
- Logs execution
- Provides monitoring dashboard

Monitor Path:
Monitor → Pipeline Runs → Activity Runs

---

# 📊 Key Features of Azure Data Factory

- 100+ Built-in Connectors
- Code-free UI
- JSON-based backend
- CI/CD Support (Git Integration)
- Parameterization
- Dynamic Content
- Error Handling
- Monitoring & Alerts

---

# 🧠 Beginner-Friendly Analogy

Think of ADF like:

Airport Control System

- Linked Service = Airport Gate
- Dataset = Passenger
- Activity = Boarding Process
- Pipeline = Flight
- Trigger = Flight Schedule
- Integration Runtime = Aircraft Engine

Everything works together automatically.
