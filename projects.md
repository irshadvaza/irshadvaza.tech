---

### Business Problem
Business users and analysts often depend on data teams to write SQL queries, creating delays in decision-making and bottlenecks in analytics workflows.

SmartSQL solves this by enabling **non-technical users to interact directly with enterprise databases using natural language**, while maintaining security and governance.

---

### Solution Overview
SmartSQL uses **Azure AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to convert natural language questions into validated SQL queries, executes them securely on SQL Server or Azure SQL, and presents results in a **clean, interactive Streamlit interface**.

---

### Key Capabilities
- Natural Language to SQL using LLMs  
- Secure SQL validation layer  
- Streamlit-based web interface  
- Support for On-Prem SQL Server and Azure SQL  
- Optional voice-based query input  
- Query history and result visualization  

---

### Architecture & Workflow
1. User enters a business question in natural language  
2. AI model generates a SQL query  
3. Validation layer checks for security and correctness  
4. Query is executed on SQL Server / Azure SQL  
5. Results are returned and visualized in Streamlit  

---

### Technology Stack
- AI: Azure AI, LLMs  
- Backend: Python  
- UI: Streamlit  
- Database: SQL Server, Azure SQL  
- Security: Query Validation Layer  
- Deployment: Azure App Service / Docker  

---

### Enterprise Use Cases
- Self-service analytics for business teams  
- Executive dashboards driven by live database queries  
- Data governance and controlled query access  
- Analytics modernization for legacy systems  

---

### Skills Demonstrated
- AI System Architecture  
- Secure Database Integration  
- Cloud Deployment Strategy  
- Enterprise Analytics Design  
- User Experience Engineering

---

### Business Problem
Environmental agencies and aquaculture professionals face challenges in **rapidly diagnosing aquatic animal health issues in the field**, especially when expert knowledge is limited or unavailable in real time.

---

### Solution Overview
AquatiAI is a **multimodal AI system** that allows users to submit **images, text, or voice queries** to receive **AI-driven disease identification and treatment recommendations**.

The platform combines **computer vision, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to deliver both global AI knowledge and **localized expert insights**.

---

### Key Capabilities
- Image-based disease detection  
- Text and voice-based interaction  
- AI-powered treatment recommendation engine  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Voice-based AI responses for field usage  
- Cloud-ready, containerized deployment  

---

### Architecture & Workflow
1. User submits image, text, or voice input  
2. Multimodal AI model analyzes the input  
3. RAG system retrieves domain-specific knowledge  
4. AI generates diagnosis and treatment guidance  
5. Results are delivered via text and voice interface  

---

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Streamlit  
- Backend: FastAPI / Node.js  
- AI Models: HuggingFace, Azure AI, Multimodal LLMs  
- Knowledge Engine: LangChain, ChromaDB  
- DevOps: Docker, GitHub CI/CD  
- Cloud: Azure (Planned Deployment)  

---

### Enterprise & Government Use Cases
- Environmental protection agencies  
- Aquaculture disease monitoring systems  
- Research institutions and marine biology labs  
- Field teams using mobile AI advisory tools  

---

### Skills Demonstrated
- Multimodal AI Architecture  
- RAG System Design  
- Cloud-Native AI Platforms  
- DevOps & CI/CD Pipelines
