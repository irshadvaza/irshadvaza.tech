# 🧪 KNN Classification – Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this lab is to build a Machine Learning classification model using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to predict whether a patient has diabetes.

This project demonstrates:

- Data preprocessing
- Handling imbalanced dataset
- Feature scaling
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation using multiple metrics
- Visualization of ROC and PR curves

## 📊 Dataset Description

We are using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

This dataset contains medical information about female patients of Pima Indian heritage.

### 🎯 Target Variable

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0     | No Diabetes |
| 1     | Diabetes |

This is a **binary classification problem**.
