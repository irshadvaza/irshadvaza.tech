# 1️⃣ Introduction to Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)

## 📌 What is RCM?

**Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** is the complete financial process hospitals use to manage patient revenue —  
from the moment a patient schedules an appointment until the provider receives full payment.

**Provider** = Hospital or Doctor  
**Revenue Cycle** = Patient Visit → Billing → Payment Collection  

In simple terms:

> RCM ensures the hospital gets paid correctly and on time for the services provided.

Even if a hospital delivers excellent clinical care, without strong RCM it can struggle financially.

# 2️⃣ End-to-End RCM Process (Step-by-Step)

## 1️⃣ Patient Appointment & Registration

The revenue cycle begins before treatment.

**Activities:**
- Appointment scheduling  
- Patient demographic collection  
- Insurance verification  
- Eligibility validation  
- Co-pay & deductible check  

This stage reduces future payment delays.

---

## 2️⃣ Insurance Verification & Financial Responsibility

Hospital checks:
- Coverage validity  
- Policy limits  
- Co-payment requirement  
- Remaining deductible  

**Example:**
- Treatment cost = $1,000  
- Insurance covers 80%  
- Patient co-pay = 20%  

Result:
- Insurance pays $800  
- Patient pays $200  

If deductible not met → patient may pay more upfront.

## 3️⃣ Services Provided (Clinical Stage)

Examples of services:
- Doctor consultation  
- Lab tests  
- Radiology  
- Surgery  
- Medication  

All services are recorded in:
- EHR (Electronic Health Record)
- Hospital Information System (HIS)

Each service is coded using:
- ICD (Diagnosis codes)  
- CPT (Procedure codes)  

Correct coding ensures accurate billing.

## 4️⃣ Medical Coding & Billing

After treatment:
- Services converted to billable codes  
- Invoice generated  
- Claim created  

Two cases:
- Insurance claim submission  
- Self-pay billing  

---

## 5️⃣ Claim Review by Insurance

Insurance evaluates:
- Coverage eligibility  
- Correct coding  
- Authorization  

Possible outcomes:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| Approved | Full payment |
| Partially Approved | Reduced payment |
| Denied | Rejected |

---

## 6️⃣ Payment Posting & Follow-up

- Payment received  
- Balance updated  
- Follow-up initiated if needed  

---

## 7️⃣ Reporting & Performance Monitoring

Hospital monitors:
- Accounts Receivable (AR) aging  
- Claim denial rate  
- Collection efficiency  
- Cash flow trends  

This completes the first part of RCM text explanation.
