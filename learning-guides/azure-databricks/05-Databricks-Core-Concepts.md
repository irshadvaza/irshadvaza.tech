## PART 1️⃣: Workspace Components  
*(Where we work in Databricks)*

---

### 1️⃣ What is a Databricks Workspace?

**🧠 Simple Meaning:**  
Workspace is the main working area in Databricks where users create, organize, and run their work.

Think of it like:

- Google Drive for data work  
- Office workspace for teams  

**🔹 What You Do in Workspace:**

- Write code  
- Create notebooks  
- Organize folders  
- Run jobs  
- Collaborate with team  

**📌 Workspace does NOT store actual data; it stores:**

- Code  
- Notebooks  
- Metadata

  ### 2️⃣ Folder (Very Easy Concept)

**📁 What is a Folder?**  
A folder organizes notebooks and files inside the workspace.

**📌 Why Folders?**

- Keep projects organized  
- Separate teams  
- Easy collaboration  

**🧾 Example Folder Structure:**


/Workspace
/Sales_Project
/Ingestion
/Transformation
/Reporting



> Just like folders on your laptop.

### 3️⃣ Notebook (Most Important Concept)

**📓 What is a Notebook?**  
A notebook is an **interactive document** where you write and run code step by step.

**🔹 What Can a Notebook Contain?**

- SQL  
- Python  
- Scala  
- Text (documentation)  
- Charts  

**📌 Example:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales;

You write → run → see output immediately.

🔹 Why Notebooks Are Powerful:

Easy learning

Easy debugging

Easy sharing

Great for training & books

That’s why Databricks is very popular in education.

4️⃣ Library (Reusable Code & Packages)

📦 What is a Library?
A library is a collection of reusable code or packages used inside Databricks.

🔹 Types of Libraries:

Python libraries (pandas, numpy)

JAR files

Wheel files

ML libraries

📌 Example:
